# Introduction

## What will you learn

Review the pipeline because sir will make it part of the exam![pipeline](r4dspics/r4dspic1.png)

## The Tidyverse

To install the tidyverse package use the code `install.packages("tidyverse")`

```{r}

```

We also installed other package by typing in the console the following code:

[c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)`("arrow","babynames","curl","duckdb","gapminder","ggrepel","ggridges","ggthemes","hexbin","janitor","Lahman","leaflet","maps","nycflights13","openxlsx","palmerpenguins","repurrrsive","tidymodels","writexl"))`

# Data Visualization

::: callout-note
## Reminder

First load `tidyverse` package
:::

```{r}
#| load-packages
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
```

## First Step

```{r}
penguins
```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```
